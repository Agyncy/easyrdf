* Open Questions
   - how should you opt to get the first value, rather than an array of objects?

   - should new EasyRdf_Graph( $url ) really do an HTTP get?
     (what if you want a new empty graph?)

   - I am currently using public instance variables
       $me->foaf_name
     Should we be using accessor methods instead?
       $me->getFoafName()

   - Should it be:
        $resource->uri;
        $resource->uri();
        $resource->getUri();
   
   - do we need a reverse index?
